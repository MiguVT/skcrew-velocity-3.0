Special thanks to the [Olyno <i class="fas fa-link"></i>](https://github.com/Olyno/skent) за создание аддона [Skent <i class="fas fa-link"></i>](https://github.com/Olyno/skent). This module was developed due to the fact that at that moment he abandoned development, but now his addon has an option for asynchronous work with files. Part of the code was borrowed from the first version of his addon.
