# Skcrew
Skript addon contains favorite addons and something more

### Addon includes:
- part of [skript-db fork by Govindas](https://git.limework.net/Limework/skript-db): added sync effect and removed pre-parse statement
- part of [skent](https://github.com/Olyno/skent) code
- some modificated [skript-gui](https://github.com/APickledWalrus/skript-gui)
(First of all, I developed this for personal use, but maybe it will be useful to someone)

### What's new?
- [Floodgate](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate) api with cumulus (bedrock forms) support (syntax like skript-gui, easy to learn)
- Run code from text, it can be not only single line
- InventoryDragEvent - its fired when player hold righclick with cursor item
- Give or drop effect, its something like (if player doesn't have space for item, it will be dropper near)
- Run as op effect
- Permission management without permission plugin
- Some system info, like amount of RAM or number of processor cores
- Regex expressions and some string operations
- Url response expression
- Full world management effects and expressions
- ViaVersion player protocol expression

Every part can be disabled in config file, something like in [SkBee](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkBee) addon
